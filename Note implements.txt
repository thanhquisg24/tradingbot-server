***Reduce strategy
step--- LR is order of Bot1 (long) on Round n ,SR is order of Bot2 (short) on Round n
0.base (long)
    if order SO1 FILLED
        Bot1 (long)
            -emit event open a new deal with reduce mode to Bot2 (short)(preference reduce# botId,ref_reduce_deal_id)
            -Cancel all TP order 
            -update current deal is reduceCount = reduceCount + 1 and deal type is REDUCE_MODE
            -place new 2 order close position (LR1#1 line is higher than (+%price by deviation config) avg_position_price  ,LR1#2 line is less than (+%price+1% by deviation config) SO1 filled price)
        Bot2 (short)
            -onEvent from Bot1 ,createDealAtmarketPrice with qty=totalQuantity deal of Bot1 with reduceCount+1 and deal type is REDUCE_MODE and ref_reduce_deal_id = deal of long need cover
            -place new 2 order close position (SR1#1 line is higher than (+(%avg_devation_long_position x 2)) avg_position_price  ,SR1#2 line is less than (+%price+1% by avg_devation_long_position) current filled price)
1.Round 1 
    -if #1 line is higher is filled 
            -close long position
